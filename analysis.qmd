## Basic Data Analysis

This report presents the results of our basic data analysis. The analysis was performed using R, and the code can be found in the `scripts` directory.

### Data Visualization

Here is a visualization of our random dataset:

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot
#| fig-cap: "Random Data with Trend Line"
#| fig-alt: "Scatter plot showing random data points with a trend line"
knitr::include_graphics("output/random_plot.png")
```

### Summary Statistics

Here are the summary statistics of our data:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics"
summary_stats <- read.csv("output/summary_stats.csv")
knitr::kable(summary_stats, format = "html")
```

The mean of y is `r read.csv("output/mean_sd.csv")$mean` and the standard deviation is `r read.csv("output/mean_sd.csv")$sd`.

```{r setup}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Basic Data Analysis

Let's create a simple dataset and visualize it.

```{r}
# Create a sample dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  x = 1:100,
  y = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
)

# Create a scatter plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Random Data with Trend Line",
       x = "Index",
       y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Summary Statistics

Here are some basic summary statistics of our data:

```{r}
summary(data$y)
```

The mean of y is `r mean(data$y)` and the standard deviation is `r sd(data$y)`.
